#### Install instructions

Installing [4chan X](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x) is **required** for StyleChan to work.

- Firefox: Requires the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) addon. Click the Install link above.

- Chrome: Requires the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl) extension. Click the Install link above. Alternatively you can download a [.crx here](https://nebukazar.github.io/StyleChan/builds/StyleChan.crx) if you are using Chromium or are not using Windows. Drag&drop into the extensions page to install.


#### Troubleshooting

- If you have any problems, try first resetting your 4chan X and StyleChan settings and restarting your browser

- Check if it's not a 4chan X issue first, StyleChan mostly deals with stylesheets not site functionality

- Something doesn't work let me know in the [Issues](https://github.com/nebukazar/StyleChan/issues) page

- Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/nebukazar/OneeChan/wiki) for instructions
